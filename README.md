# Lung Cancer Prediction
___
### Use Case
We have been employed as an ML Engineer in a Hospital (P-Health), upon reaching there we noticed that our company spends a lot of money and resources running tests and examinations on patients to see if they have lung cancer or not.

We have proposed that we can build a ML model that can predict the patient that have higher chances of having cancer, of course we our model won't be 100% sure if someone has or not, but we would create one that predicts if someone that has lung cancer more
